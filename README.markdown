===========================

Setup
-----

Just pop in your Apache Website.

A few notes:
* You need a config.py with your details, as my API keys are mine
* CGI needs enabling
* I have a DokuWiki set up at http://localhost/wiki/ which you will need the search.php file from the doku folder

Config.py
---------

	# Config

	bing_api_key = "key"
	instagram_key = "key"
	flickr_key = "key"

	dictionary_com_key = "key"
	embedy_ly_key="key"

	default_weather = "Your location"
	weatherunderground_key = "key"
